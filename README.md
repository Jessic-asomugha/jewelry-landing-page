## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure and content of the website.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework used for custom styling.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework used for responsive design, grid layout, and carousel functionality.
- **Bootstrap Icons**: Icons used for various sections (e.g., About section, Footer).

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The page is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Image Slideshow**: The hero section and gallery images are dynamically updated with a sliding effect.
- **Testimonial Carousel**: Rotating testimonials using Bootstrap’s carousel component.
- **Custom Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for layout and custom styles, providing a unique look and feel.

## Structure

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is used to handle:
- **Overall Layout**: Flexbox and grid layout utilities are used to arrange content and sections responsively.
- **Hero Section**: The hero section with a large background image, centered text, and a CTA button is styled using Tailwind’s spacing, typography, and background utilities.
- **Buttons**: The "Explore Now" button is styled with Tailwind's utility classes, including background color, padding, and hover effects.
- **Custom Text Styles**: Text in sections like "About Us" and "What Our Customers Say" uses Tailwind utilities for font sizes, colors, and spacing.

### Bootstrap
Bootstrap is used for:
- **Navigation**: The header includes a navigation bar with Bootstrap classes for responsive design. The dropdown and mobile menu toggle functionality are handled by Bootstrap's `navbar` component.
- **Carousel**: The testimonial section utilizes Bootstrap's carousel component to display rotating testimonials.
- **Grid System**: The "About Us" section uses Bootstrap’s grid system to organize the content into columns.
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap's responsive grid ensures that the layout adapts based on the screen size. For example, the navigation bar is hidden on smaller screens and toggled via a button.
- **Icons**: Bootstrap Icons are used for visual elements like the "About Us" section, where each point (e.g., Quality Craft, Premium Materials) is represented with a relevant icon.
